Good night people.
The following is an exercise in programming logic, covering the subjects of Object Oriented Programming.
Create a class to represent a person, with the private attributes of name, date of birth and height;
Create the necessary public methods for sets and gets, as well as a method to return all of a person's data;
Create a method to calculate the person's age;
Create a new class with the main method;
Create an object of the previous class;
Create a flow with JOptionPane to
  1) fill the object,
  2) display the information for that object.
Challenge: make the age calculation identify whether or not the person has completed a birthday in the current year.
Example:
if dateBirth = 12/01/2020 result age = 0
if dateBirth = 01/01/2020 age result = 1

Suggestion:
CurrentDay = 1020
monthBirth = 1201
current year = 2021
year of birth = 2020
age = current year - yearBirth
if (mesDiaBirth >mesDiaCurrent ) then age = age - 1
