/*Here is my explanation of my OOP exercise 

Create a class to represent a person, with the private attributes of name, date of birth and height;
Create the necessary public methods for sets and gets, and also a method to return all of a person's data;
Create a method to calculate the person's age;
Create a new class with the main method;
Create an object of the previous class;
Create a flow with JOptionPane to
   1) fill the object,
   2) display the information for that object.

    STEP 1
    Creat a Java Project with Two Java files. 
    One for the main class and the other for the 
    Object class

    IN YOUR OBJECT CLASS eg. (Human)

    STEP 2
   Since we are going to work with dates. We need to 
   imort 
   1. Java.time.LocalDate
   2. Java. time. MothDate
   3. Java DateTimeFormatter: this helps to put the 
       time in our desired format.

    STEP 3

    Creat a public class with private variables 

    Creat setters and getters for our private variables 
    Eg. setName and getname 

    STEP 4
    using the DateTimeFormatter declear you date 
    parameters as needed 
    An if statement is helpful for age claculation 

    STEP 5
    Using the toString method prepare your output

    IN THE MAIN CLASS

    STEP 1
    Import your Java.time packages 
            LocalDate
            DateTimeFormatter
            you need JOptionPane 
    
    declear your class

    you need a public static void name() 

    STEP 2

    Creat and Object of the prvious class

    Using the JOptionPane impute showInputDialog
    get users information using the set method and store 
    them in the right variable types 

    display the info using JOptionPane and the 
    toSting */
